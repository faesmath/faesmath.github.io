Welcome to the webpage for the Fall 2019 MATH 127 course -- Elementary Calculus I -- at the FAES Graduate School at NIH. A textbook covering the standard topics of single variable calculus is required for this course.
The adopted book is [Calculus](https://www.cengage.com/c/calculus-8e-stewart/) by James Stewart (note that there are different versions of the same book covering single variable, multiple variable, or both parts), or alternatively [Biocalculus](https://www.cengage.com/c/biocalculus-calculus-probability-and-statistics-for-the-life-sciences-1e-stewart/9781305114036/) by James Stewart and Troy Day -- both books cover all the necessary material with slightly different approaches, the former more detailed, the latter more contextualized for life sciences.
A third alternative is the [Apex Calculus](http://www.apexcalculus.com/) textbook -- adopted in previous semesters -- which has an open online version and affordable hard copies.

The course syllabus can be found [here](./files/math127_syllabus.pdf).
