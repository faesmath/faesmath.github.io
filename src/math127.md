Welcome to the webpage for the Fall 2019 MATH 127 course -- Elementary Calculus I -- at the FAES Graduate School at NIH. This course begins with a review of pre-calculus topics, aiming at an audience of students with diverse backgrounds, and swiftly enters the territory of classic "Calculus I", as offered in many parts of the world to students who do not have previous exposure to the topic. It starts from single-variable functions [i.e. \\(y =f(x) \\) ] to define concepts related to the infinite and infinitesimal, like limits when variables tend to zero or infinity, instantaneous rates of change (derivatives), and areas under a curve (integrals).
These ideas appear often in nature, and these examples will be used to motivate and conceptualize core concepts in calculus.

A textbook covering the standard topics of single variable calculus is required for this course. The adopted book is [Biocalculus](https://www.cengage.com/c/biocalculus-calculus-probability-and-statistics-for-the-life-sciences-1e-stewart/9781305114036/) by James Stewart and Troy Day, or alternatively [Calculus](https://www.cengage.com/c/calculus-8e-stewart/) by James Stewart (note that there are different versions of the same book covering single variable, multiple variable, or both parts) -- both books cover all the necessary material with slightly different approaches, the former more contextualized for life sciences, the latter more traditional and detailed. Notice that James Stewart's _Calculus_ has two volumes; the first covers the syllabus for this course, the second intended for multivariable calculus, which is the topic of [MATH 128](http://faesmath.github.io/math128.html), and a combined volume that covers both courses.

_Biocalculus_ covers the syllabus of this course, but only partially covers that which follows.
A third alternative is the [Apex Calculus](http://www.apexcalculus.com/) textbook -- adopted in previous semesters -- which has an open online version and affordable hard copies.

Here you can find a preliminary [syllabus](http://faesmath.github.io/files/FAES_MATH127_FALL2019_syllabus.pdf).
