Calculus for the life sciences, Biocalculus for short, is a first course in calculus geared towards researchers biology and biomedicine who have little or no previous exposure the subject. It covers all fundamental topics of single-variable calculus, but with a focus on concepts and application in the natural sciences, as opposed to proofs of theorems or arcane symbol manipulation.

The course includes a brief review of [review of pre-calculus](http://faesmath.github.io/files/diagnostic_tests.pdf) topics like [algebra](https://stewartcalculus.com/data/BIOCALCULUS_CPS/upfiles/bio_reviewofalgebra.pdf),<!-- https://stewartcalculus.com/data/CALCULUS_8E/upfiles/6e_reviewofalgebra.pdf --> [analytic geometry](https://stewartcalculus.com/data/BIOCALCULUS_CPS/upfiles/bio_reviewofanalgeom.pdf)  <!-- https://stewartcalculus.com/data/CALCULUS_8E/upfiles/6e_reviewofanalgeom.pdf-->, and [trigonometric functions](http://faesmath.github.io/files/calculus_reviewoftrig.pdf).
Students who think they would benefit from a refresher are encouraged to take a foundations and precalculus course.

<!-- students who come from less quantitative backgrounds or think they would benefit from a refresher in precalculus are encouraged to pick up a free digital version of [APEX Pre-calculus](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12b2cwH7afXhsYSDb-QCWKmFK2QCq7UfY), glance over an online pre-calculus course (such as [Khan Academy's](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus) or [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/precalculus) before or at the beginning of the course -->

The course then quickly leaps into the mathematics of infinity and beyond: infinitesimal quantities, differentials, infinite sequences, and whether it is possible to divide by zero.

Practical applications of Calculus in research will be emphasized, especially mathematical modeling of biological systems: Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models, optimization, population dynamics (e.g. epidemiological) and equilibria, phase plots analysis, among others.


**Prerequisites**
A pre-calculus course (half-semester or equivalent) is recommended, but not required. Knowledge of trigonometry, basic algebra, and basic graphing is required (but a brief review is part of the course).

Learning Objectives:

- Understand the concept of functions, their limits, and continuity
- Become familiar with differentiation and integration techniques of single-variable functions
- Introduce applications of calculus to scientific research
