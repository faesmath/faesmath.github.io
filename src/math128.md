Welcome to the webpage for the Spring 2020 MATH 128 course -- Calculus II: Multivariable Calculus -- at the FAES Graduate School at NIH. This course extends the previous calculus course ([MATH 127](https://faesmath.github.io/math127); one semester of calculus is a prerequisite) to include the study of functions of multiple variables and their nontrivial consequences to applications and theory.

The course begins with a review of calculus, vectors, and parametric functions, then moving on to partial derivatives, maxima and minima of multivariable functions, double and triple integrals, and some advanced topics of vector calculus. In addition to the conceptual changes, moving from one-dimensional domain and range functions \\(f(x)\\) to vector-valued ones such as \\(F(x,y,z) \\) allows realistic models from the natural sciences to be addressed and expands the box of calculus tools to an extensive and flexible set.

A textbook covering multivariable calculus is required, so all students need at least a (free) digital copy of [APEX Calculus](http://www.apexcalculus.com/) (affordable hard copies are available in different volumes; they should include at least chapters 10-14 for this course); it is a concise text that covers all the essential topics. Alternatively, [Calculus: Early Transcendentals](https://www.cengage.com/c/calculus-early-transcendentals-9e-stewart/9781337613927PF/) (single volume or multivariable calculus book) is recommended to students who would like to have a more traditional (and perhaps extensive) textbook on the topic.

Here you will be able to find a preliminary [syllabus](http://faesmath.github.io/files/FAES_MATH128_Spring2020_syllabus.pdf).
If you are enrolled in this course you can log into the student course page using [this link](https://canvas.instructure.com/login/canvas), or you can enroll [here](https://faes.org/courses).
