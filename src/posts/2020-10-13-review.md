At this point you know how to compute an inner, or dot product between vectors (\\( \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\)), matrix multiplication (\\(AB\\)), and the operation of a matrix on a vector (\\(A\\mathbf{x}\\)). Each of these operations has their rules and properties, like the dot product between orthogonal vectors being zero, and \\(A\\mathbf{x}\\) amounting to a linear combination of the columns of the matrix, but we will skip over most of them as well as the numerical calculation details to focus on the algebraic manipulation of the main objects of linear algebra: matrices and vectors.
